# Physics
* how to account for clump size to determine whether they are relevant?
* distribution of clump sizes and masses
* non-spherical clumps
* non-radial trajectories

# Numerics
## Software
* check the impact of the 1% of vinf initial speed assumption
## Hardware
* CPU parallelization (OpenMPI or MP?) and then GPU
