Aim of 1st part : getting insights on the variability of the column density induced by the clumps only —> Vici+17 on Vela X-1

Lorenzo Ducci’s style : an heuristic approach whose aim is to capture the dependence of the stochastic properties with the main observables of the problem (eg the mass loss rate, the size of a clump, the terminal wind speed).

A lot can be done analytically for the mean value BUT

NH very variable from an orbit to another one => limited interest of the median value only.

More difficult to get analytically the stochastic properties

key-parameters:
	- radii of clumps (for now, no distribution like Lorenzo)
	- mean distance between clumps

outputs:
	- representation of the clumps and the orbit
	- histograms of NH per orbital bin (~landscape diagrams of Felix for Vela X-1)
	- time correlation
